## Welcome

We are in the process of getting the initial foundations in place to bring
Security BSides (or just "BSides" for short) to Boulder, Co.

## Who

BSides is a community driven event, and represents work from different groups in
the Boulder Area.

## What

BSides Boulder will be a single day security conference.  Topics will come from
the community and will be evaluated by the CFP (Call for Paper) Committee.

## Where

We are currently looking at some options for a venue, we will have more
information about attendance size and other details when we have that
information.

## Why

Boulder has an immense technology presence between the University, Startups,
SMBs, and Corporations that are housed within its borders.  Many of those
businesses have security professionals, aspiring technologist, or many of the
other titles that are attracted to the BSides conferences.  We love the
community and we wanted to give us an event that would allow us to come together
as a community, showcase some talent, and learn from each other.

## When

We are currently targeting April 2020 for the event and we should have more
information about this in the days to come.
