# BSides is coming to Boulder

Good news everybody....

BSides is coming to Boulder... in spite of the COVID-19.  We are still at it and
with our new scheduled date we are looking to put on a good event no matter what
happens.  We know that right now everyone has the virus at the forefront of their
mind, we wanted to push the event to a time where there is the possibility for
us all to gather in person.  In the end if that isn't possible then the show
will go on.

Since this is our first event we didn't want to go full virtual without there
being a change to make sure that we were fully prepared for that to happen, now
we have contingency plans in place to make sure that we are going to be able to
offer you a good experince no matter what happens.

## Want to Help ?

If you are interested in helping out to make this become a reality... we need
your help.  Check out [Volunteer Page](/volunteers/)
