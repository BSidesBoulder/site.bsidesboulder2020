## Q: What kind of web developer would use ascii art for a logo

A: one without graphic design skills. We are currently looking for submissions
from artist for our logo since we don't have one already. If you are interested
in helping us with any of the branding, please go to the
[volunteer](/volunteers/) and select graphic design.
