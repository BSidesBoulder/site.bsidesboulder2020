COVID-19 Update May 2020

TL;DR; => BSidesBoulder has been rescheduled for Oct 10, 2020 this time we are prepared, we are hoping that we will be in person, but realistically we are planning for virtual.

The world that we livin now is so much different than the world that we were living in when we decided that we needed to postpone. At that time we were hoping that the threat that was in front of us was going to be something that could be put under control and if everyone followed the directions that we would be back to normal.  But the reality has caught up with us over the last couple of months, and with that reality comes a bit more clarity about what is being asked of us and what we can do for the community.

We now know that there is a likelihood that this is going to be something that we are dealing with for a long time to come.  But it felt wrong for us to cancel something that we (both the members of BSidesBoulder and the Community as a whole) have contributed so much to and wanted to see succeed.  So we are pressing forward in two different directions: one plan has us heading into the direction of a in person event (with significantly more stringent health precautions) and the other in the direction of a virtual conference (possibly a mix of the two).  We as a collective are still hopeful that we will again be able to meet and network in person.  While we hope for the best, we must plan for the worst.

We are more confident about the position that we are in now and how we can handle things going forward.  We are still committed to putting on a great event, even if we all can’t be together.  With that in mind we are moving forward with BSidesBoulder in the spirit that things have to keep moving forward for us to return to normal one day.  No matter what happens, BSides Boulder will take place October 10, 2020, either in the halls of CU or in the series of tubes we call the internet.

Stay Safe,

The BSidesBoulder Team.

# May 2020 Update

With the recent outbreak of COVID-19, especially since there is now at least one confirmed case in Boulder, the BSides Boulder planning team has made the difficult decision to postpone the event. Please understand that this was not an easy, or unanimous decision and it was very much debated, but in the end our goal is to put on a quality event with good content and great people. The choices we debated were between postponement and doing a 100% virtual event. Up to this point the planning team, and volunteers joining the planning meetings, have been focused on an in person event and we feel that it would be a disservice to make an attempt to pivot this late in the game to a virtual event.

We are still working on the details for a new date so please bear with us as we work to figure this out. There are still quite a few moving pieces that we need to consider and logistics that will need to be handled. We will be sending out another communication in the next couple weeks with more information. While we may not have everything set by then, we do think it’s important to remain transparent and appreciate your understanding. 

In the meantime we will be offering refunds to those who would like them, or you can hold your ticket for the later date.

Thank you, and be safe!

The BSides Boulder Planning team
