With the recent outbreak of COVID-19, especially since there is now at least one confirmed case in Boulder, the BSides Boulder planning team has made the difficult decision to postpone the event. Please understand that this was not an easy, or unanimous decision and it was very much debated, but in the end our goal is to put on a quality event with good content and great people. The choices we debated were between postponement and doing a 100% virtual event. Up to this point the planning team, and volunteers joining the planning meetings, have been focused on an in-person event and we feel that it would be a disservice to make an attempt to pivot this late in the game to a virtual event.

We are still working on the details for a new date so please bear with us as we work to figure this out. There are still quite a few moving pieces that we need to consider and logistics that will need to be handled. We will be sending out another communication in the next couple weeks with more information. While we may not have everything set by then, we do think itâ€™s important to remain transparent and appreciate your understanding. 

In the meantime we will be offering refunds to those who would like them, or you can hold your ticket for the later date.

Thank you, and be safe!

The BSides Boulder Planning team
