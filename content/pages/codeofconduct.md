We have ZERO TOLERANCE for harassment of any kind, be it physical, verbal, or sexual.

We strive to create an environment that encourages the free and open sharing of
ideas. We’ve created a home at BSides Boulder and have invited you all inside
to be inspired and educated. It is impossible to keep the free and open sharing
of ideas without risking someone getting their feelings hurt. We don’t expect
adult and professional behavior at all times; a little mischief can be fun. We
do however, expect you to be respectful of our space and our other invited
guests.

In the end it is up to us, the organizers of BSides Boulder, to define bad
behavior. If you are engaging in bad behavior (e.g. heckling or haranguing
speakers, or violating the photo policy), you will be given a warning that your
behavior is not acceptable. If you continue, you will be asked to leave.

Unless, of course, your bad behavior is so egregious that it warrants immediate
ejection from the conference. (e.g. initiating a physical altercation or
attempting to defraud the conference or the venue.)

If someone is engaging with you in a way that makes you afraid or uncomfortable,
please inform a member of our Safety Operations team (in the BSides Boulder
SafetyOps shirts) or a staff member (in the BSides Staff shirts).

We have a special group in Safety Operations who are trained to handle such
situations. They have an escalation path and will help you determine the next
steps for you to feel safe and ensure your concerns are promptly addressed. This
could include any or all of the following: contacting hotel security, local law
enforcement, or other emergency services as needed.

**TL;DR** Do not be an ass or we will kick your ass out, and we’re the final
arbitrators of what being an ass means.
