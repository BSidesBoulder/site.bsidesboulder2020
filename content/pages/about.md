## About BSides Boulder

In case you hadn't heard we are attempting to bring the BSides Conference to
Boulder, Co.

## About BSides

Each BSides is a community-driven framework for building events for and by
information security community members.  The goal is to expand the spectrum of
conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time.  It creates
opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate
atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with
discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations
for the next-big-thing are happening.

## About the Team

need.  Feel free to reach out to the team via the Transparency page.
