## About BSidesBoulder Conference

In case you hadn't heard, we are attempting to bring the BSides Conference to
Boulder, CO.  

Every story starts somewhere, and with the Boulder incarnation of BSides it started with the frustration with another
event that was being hosted (no ill will, every group has to make decisions; the end result benefits both of the
groups and the community as a whole) in the area.  Out of this frustration spawned a group of people who said in the 
way that many hackers do... we can do it better.  In the conference room of Rule 4 the initial group of four people met
and founded BSidesBoulder.

What we couldn't have predicted was the pandemic would overtake the country in the spring of 2020 forcing us to
our original date of April 18, 2020.  No one could have predicted it, but we have done our best in trying to bring it back
around for an in person conference for October 10th (which at the time seemed like we might be able to make work). With
that also failing we shifted to a completely online model.

Did we achieve our goal of doing it better? Time will tell, but regardless of where we end up the adventure and hopefully
the end product have been worth it.

## About BSides

Each BSides is a community-driven framework for building events for and by
information security community members.  The goal is to expand the spectrum of
conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time.  It creates
opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate
atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with
discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations
for the next-big-thing are happening.
