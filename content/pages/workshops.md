# Capture the Flag with Elastic - BSides Boulder

**Event name:** Capture the Flag with Elastic

**Date:** Sat, 10/10/2020, ??? Mountain Time

**Duration:** 2 hours

## Facilitators

David French, Senior Security Research Engineer, @threatpunter

Matteo Rebeschini, Security Specialist, @mrebeschini

## Description

During this Capture the Flag (CTF) event, you will use Elastic Security to investigate a realistic attack scenario. Your organization is breached. You will receive a threat intelligence report that provides details of how a partner company was recently compromised. Your goal is to investigate and identify evidence of the threat group's malicious behavior.

The cybersecurity community has embraced the free and open Elastic Stack (also known as ELK) that provides search and analytics capabilities required by security operations and threat hunting teams. Elastic Security is built on top of the Elastic Stack and combines SIEM and Endpoint Security, and includes our free detection rules.

If you haven't used Elastic Security before, don't worry, we'll provide a short demonstration before beginning the CTF.

## Attendee Prerequisites

Who should attend? This event is meant for Security and IT professionals who want to develop or practice analysis and investigative skills that are applicable to both open source and commercial technology solutions.

Prerequisites: An understanding of endpoint and network fundamentals. Experience working in an IT or security operations role such as a SOC or incident response analyst is a bonus. Experience using a SIEM, knowledge of adversary tradecraft, and Kibana Query Language (KQL) is a nice-to-have, but not required.

To participate in the CTF exercise, use a laptop running an up-to-date version of Windows 10 or MacOS and at least one of the following Internet browsers: IE11+, Firefox, or Chrome. Prepare any peripherals necessary for Internet connectivity and accessibility.
