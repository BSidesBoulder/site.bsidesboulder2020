  We have fantastic news, we have managed to secure a location and some
  sponsorship in one fell swoop.  Which means that this thing is happening.
  Courtesy of University of Colorado Boulder we now have a venue and a date.
  April 18, 2020 we will be gathering on the Campus to talk about all things
  security. Looking forward to seeing you there.
