  We have reached that part of the year where we are starting to slow down, but
  don't mistake that for things stopping. The next couple of meetings are going
  to be a bit off schedule with the next meeting being Dec 11, 2019 and the next
  meeting after that being Jan 8, 2020. Also, in big news the first batch of
  tickets will be on sale Jan 18th, more on that to come.
