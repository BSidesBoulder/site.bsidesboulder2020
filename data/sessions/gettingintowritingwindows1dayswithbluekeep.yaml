    The talk will start with an intro into BlueKeep and a brief overview for people unfamiliar with the topic. The talk will cover all phases of the exploitation process from identifying the vulnerability to writing a fully functional exploit. During the talk an emphasis will be placed on the tools and approach I used to write a the exploit prior to any public exploit code release. It will provide resources that I found to be invaluable during my research. 

    The overarching goal will attempt to show how anyone interested can get into windows kernel exploitation.
