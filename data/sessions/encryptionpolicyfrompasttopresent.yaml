  name: Encryption Policy, from past to present and what lies ahead
  sessionid: eppp
  abstract: |
    The debates around encryption are not new. The first encryption case dates back to the very early days of the United States as a country.

     However, the ability to develop, implement, and use encryption has become a higher stakes matter as technology has started to take over every aspect of our daily lives. In this talk, I'll cover the history of the encryption debates, both here in the U.S. as well as internationally, as well as where those debates are today. I'll then discuss where the conversations are headed and give recommendations on how people from any background or area of specialization can -- and should -- get involved.
